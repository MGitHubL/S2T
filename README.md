S2T is a method from paper "Self-Supervised Temporal Graph Learning with Temporal and Structural Intensity Alignment".

We have uploaded the runnable code version, which will be further improved after the acceptance of the paper.

Our code is improved based on TREND, which can be referenced: https://github.com/WenZhihao666/TREND
